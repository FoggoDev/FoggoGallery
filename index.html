                        I have created 2 projects that you can download and others that are not finished yet.
                        I created this website to share my animations, 3D models,
                        and games that I have been able to make from 2021 to 2023.
                        I update this site as soon as I create something new! Enjoy your visit.</p>

            <h1>My story</h1>
            <div class="videotextall">
                <p>At the age of 13, I discovered the software Source Filmmaker [a Valve animation software].
                    I created many animations based on FNAF. Later, around the age of 15, I discovered a YouTube channel 
                    named Nico [a YouTube channel that focuses on UE4 game development]. I loved his videos, so I decided to buy 
                    his UE4 course to try it out. At first, I wasn't a fan, but as time went by, I became more passionate. When I turned 16, 
                    I started working with Blender. Of course, I began by creating a 3D model of a donut, but as time went on, I was able to 
                    create more beautiful models. And so, I'm sharing everything with you here.</p>
