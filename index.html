                <p>Hi, I'm Léo Party, I'm 19, and I'm a 3D creator. 
                    At the moment, I've created 2 downloadable projects, and I'm currently developing new ones. 
                    I created this website to share my animations, 3D models and games that I've been able to make from 2021 to 2023. 
                    I'll update my website as soon as I create something new! ✨ Enjoy your visit ! ✨</p>

                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>At the age of 13, I discovered Source Filmmaker [an animation software from Valve] and made a lot of animations based on FNAF. 
                    Later, when I was about 15, I discovered a YouTube channel called Nico [a YouTube channel dedicated to UE4 game development]. 
                    I loved his videos, so I decided to buy his UE4 course to try it out. At the beginning, I wasn't a big fan, but as time went by, I became more and more passionate about it. 
                    It was at the age of 16 that I started to work with Blender. Of course, I started by making a 3D model of a doughnut, but as time went on I was able to make more and more beautiful models.</p>
